Quoridor
My Project is a 2 or 4 player abstract strategy board game. 
The objective  of the game is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the gameboard from which it begins. 

Rules: 
1. Player can only move their piece one square at a time.
2. Player have two choices when it's their turn: either move thier piece or place a barrier on the board to make
it difficult for their opponents to reach the end of the board.
3. For a two person game, each player has access to 10 barries (walls). In a four player game, each player has access to 5 walls each. 
4. When placing a barrier, a player must always leave a way to reach the end of the board. Thus, one cannot box in a player on their first three moves. 
5. Walls can be placed directly between two spaces in any grove not already occupied by a wall. Walls can be place either veritacally or horizontally, however a wall may not be placed which cuts off the only remaning path of any pawn to the side of the board it must reach to win the game. 
6. Pawns can be moved to an adjacent space (not diagonally), or, if adjacent to another pawn, a player may jump over that pawn. A player may move diagonally if jumping over another pawn will result in running into a wall. Players may not jump over walls.

Board Setup: 
• The game is played on a game board of 81 sqaure spaces (9X9).
• Each player is represented by a pawn which begins at the center space of one edge of the board.
• Walls are flat two-space-wide pieces which can be placed grooves that run between spaces.
• There are a total of 20 walls which are divided evenly between the number of players playing the game.
